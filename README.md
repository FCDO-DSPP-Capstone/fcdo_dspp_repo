# FCDO data capstone 

un_notebook have the first run. All datasets you want to add please load them in "data_in". All outputs from your codes please store them in "outputs".  

Thers an HTML file on outputs folder with the pca interactive visualization. Download it to see it. Now its deployed to the web page.

Important Next steps, some coments and packages.  

For interactive network graphs, some possilbe packages:
   - https://vega.github.io/vega/examples/force-directed-layout/  
   - https://plotly.com/python/network-graphs/
   - http://tinyurl.com/2a4nhxhk (Vega example)
   - https://dash.plotly.com/cytoscape#dash-cytoscape

Possible grpahs to make:  
    - Similarity scores between countries both on voting pattenr and on speech patterns. USing heat map visuzlaition from vega lite or similar.

 

 -- About UN votes and UN speeches connections
   In theory is possible to match speeches dates and voting dates to see similiarty and think to build a connection system 

-- It would be possible to make a By sesssion PCA clustering based on speeches similarity in a given session
